```text
Rebuild one page for image-to-editable-ppt.

Run dir: {{RUN_DIR}}
Page id: {{PAGE_ID}}
Page dir: {{PAGE_DIR}}
Source image: {{SOURCE_IMAGE}}

You own only this Page dir. Do not edit deck_manifest.json, page_jobs.json, notes_manifest.json, final outputs, the original input, or any other page directory.

MANDATORY FIRST ACTION — before looking at the source image, before any decision, before any tool call other than reading: read these three files in full. Do not skim, do not rely on prior knowledge of them, do not start reconstruction first and consult them later. Every past failure mode of this skill is encoded in them; any decision made without having read them is invalid and will be redone.
- {{SKILL_ROOT}}/references/page-decision-tree.md — the single source of truth for all object-source decisions: the three-step decision process, text-hints usage, the final self-check, and the fix-versus-warning split.
- {{SKILL_ROOT}}/references/manifest-schema.md — the field contracts for manifest.json, validation.json, page_result.json, and imagegen-jobs.json.
- {{SKILL_ROOT}}/references/cli-helper.md — editppt command syntax and examples.

Hard rules (reminders only; the details and rationale live in the references above):
1. Every non-text foreground visual object must be separated through the `editppt image edit --image <source.png>` asset-sheet workflow per page-decision-tree.md section 2. There is no fallback: no native-shape/emoji/text-symbol approximation, no direct source.png crops, no downgrade to a warning.
2. Execute the three steps in order: (1) background recognition and repair, (2) foreground asset separation, (3) native element reconstruction. Do not consume the text hints in your page dir before the step-1/2 decisions are recorded.
3. manifest.json is the authoritative build source for page validation and final deck assembly. Build page.pptx and preview.png from manifest.json with the deterministic runtime, never with separate page-local PowerPoint code that bypasses the manifest.
4. All box_px / points_px / polygon_px values are source.png pixels. Reuse page_request.json.slide and page_request.json.content_box unchanged — do not convert the page to 16:9 or recalculate the canvas; the runtime maps source-pixel coordinates into content_box. Positioned objects without coordinates are page failures.
5. validation.json must contain a top-level boolean `passed`. Deterministic validation passing never waives an object-source rule.

Image backend: before any image generation or image editing, use the `editppt image` backend specified by `page_request.json.image_backend`. If `editppt image` is unavailable, first follow the CLI error guidance and try `codex login` or `editppt config`; if it is still unavailable, stop the current page and write `validation.json` with `"passed": false`. Do not complete the page using approximate editable structure when required foreground asset separation cannot run. When you need parameter details for the image backend, input images, batch JSONL, clean bases, or asset sheets, read `editppt image --help` and the relevant subcommand help.

Goal: rebuild the source page as object-level editable PowerPoint. Do not invent an object-source strategy outside `page-decision-tree.md`.

If the page dir already contains artifacts (manifest.json, page.pptx, validation.json, assets, ...) from a previous failed attempt, treat them as untrusted: run the full decision process yourself and re-derive every artifact. Never flip a leftover validation.json to `passed: true` or return leftover outputs without having rebuilt and re-verified them — the previous attempt failed for a reason recorded in its validation.json; read it.

Work through the page in this order:
1. Build the page inventory (Pre-Decision Checklist in page-decision-tree.md).
2. Decide the background (page-decision-tree.md section 1) and record `background_strategy`.
3. Decide and separate foreground assets (section 2). Submit all step-1/2 image jobs (clean bases and asset sheets) as one `editppt image batch` call, then record and process the results with `editppt image import` and `editppt image process-sheet`.
4. Rebuild native text, shapes, and tables (section 3). Fill `text_boxes` from the measured text hints per section 3.1; render formulas with `editppt formula render-latex` per section 3.2.
5. Write manifest.json following the field contracts in manifest-schema.md, including `text_inventory`, `visual_inventory`, `background_strategy`, `quality_checks`, and positioned `text_boxes`/`images`/`shapes`.
6. Build the artifacts with the deterministic runtime: `editppt page build {{PAGE_DIR}}` (writes page.pptx and preview.png from manifest.json), then `editppt page contact-sheet {{PAGE_DIR}}`, then `editppt page validate {{PAGE_DIR}}` — it runs the same manifest-contract checks `editppt run record` will run, so fix every reported issue here, inside the page.

The Page dir must contain when you return:
- manifest.json
- imagegen-jobs.json
- page.pptx
- preview.png
- split_assets_contact.png
- validation.json
- page_result.json

validation.json and page_result.json must follow the exact shapes defined in manifest-schema.md: validation.json carries the top-level boolean `passed` (not only a nested or renamed field), and page_result.json carries the minimal required key set.

Before returning, run the Final Self-Check in page-decision-tree.md once: compare preview.png and split_assets_contact.png to the source, confirm `editppt page validate {{PAGE_DIR}}` passes, confirm validation.json contains top-level `passed: true`, and confirm all required outputs exist. Page-local issues are fixed inside the current page by you before returning.

On failure — when a hard rule cannot be satisfied or a required tool is unavailable — stop and return a page failure: write validation.json with `"passed": false` and the concrete failure reason (what failed, the exact error, what the parent must fix), plus page_result.json referencing whatever artifacts exist (omit keys for artifacts that were never produced). Do not fabricate the remaining artifacts and do not build an approximate page to make validation pass; the parent agent will fix the root cause and dispatch a fresh worker.

Return only:
page_manifest=`<absolute path>`
page_pptx=`<absolute path>`
preview=`<absolute path>`
contact_sheet=`<absolute path>`
validation=`<absolute path>`
page_result=`<absolute path>`
```
