# Manifest Schema

This document describes the responsibilities, owners, and current field contracts for `editppt` run/page JSON files. All key state is advanced by `editppt` commands; page reconstructors write only page-local files.

## `deck_manifest.json`

Owner: created by `editppt prepare`; `editppt run backend` may update the image backend; `editppt run finalize` reads it and writes completion time.

Purpose:

- Input type.
- Page order.
- Page manifest paths.
- Notes manifest path.
- Final output path.
- Run-level image backend contract.
- Original user request.

Key fields:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "run_id": "job-id",
  "input_type": "image|images|pdf|pptx",
  "max_concurrent_pages": 6,
  "image_backend": {},
  "pages": [],
  "notes_manifest": "notes_manifest.json",
  "output": "final/origin_edited.pptx"
}
```

`image_backend` is written with defaults by `editppt prepare` and may be overwritten by `editppt run backend` when needed.

## `page_jobs.json`

Owner: created by `editppt prepare`, updated by `editppt run` commands.

Purpose:

- Source of truth for page state.
- Dispatch records.
- Result records.

Structure:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "run_id": "job-id",
  "max_concurrent_pages": 6,
  "pages": [
    {
      "page_id": "page_001",
      "status": "pending",
      "page_dir": "pages/page_001",
      "page_request": "pages/page_001/page_request.json",
      "source": "pages/page_001/source.png",
      "dispatch": null,
      "result": null
    }
  ]
}
```

`dispatch` is written by `editppt run dispatch`. `result` is written by `editppt run record`. `accepted` is written by `editppt run finalize`.

## `page_request.json`

Owner: `editppt prepare`.

Purpose: task boundary for the page worker.

Includes:

- page id
- page directory
- source image
- slide size
- content box
- max concurrent pages
- allowed write scope
- required outputs
- user constraints
- image backend contract

Must not include:

- page type prediction
- `imagegen_required` prediction
- object-level decisions

If the run uses an image backend, `page_request.json` must contain the same `image_backend`.

`slide` and `content_box` are computed automatically by `editppt prepare`. Inputs close to 16:9 use the standard widescreen canvas; other inputs use a custom canvas converted from the source image pixel dimensions. The agent must copy these two fields into the page `manifest.json` and must not compress, stretch, or recalculate the canvas.

## `page_result.json`

Owner: created by the page worker, validated by `editppt run record`.

Includes:

- manifest path
- imagegen jobs path
- page pptx path
- preview path
- contact sheet path
- validation path
- page-local output hashes, which may be supplemented by `editppt run record`

Minimal required shape (paths are relative to the page directory):

```json
{
  "page_manifest": "manifest.json",
  "imagegen_jobs": "imagegen-jobs.json",
  "page_pptx": "page.pptx",
  "preview": "preview.png",
  "contact_sheet": "split_assets_contact.png",
  "validation": "validation.json",
  "page_result": "page_result.json"
}
```

The `manifest` artifact is the authoritative page source for final assembly. `editppt run finalize` rebuilds the final deck from recorded page manifests in page order. The `page_pptx` artifact remains a page-level deliverability artifact and is validated by `editppt run record`, but it is not the final assembly input.

## `pages/page_NNN/validation.json`

Owner: created by the page worker, read by `editppt run record`.

Purpose: page-level deliverability conclusion.

Must contain at top level:

```json
{
  "passed": true
}
```

`passed` must be a boolean. `editppt run record` only reads top-level `passed` to decide whether the page can enter final assembly. `status: "pass"`, `runtime_validation.passed`, or other nested fields may remain as supplemental information, but they cannot replace top-level `passed`.

## `pages/page_NNN/manifest.json`

Owner: page worker.

Purpose: source of truth for page-level PPTX construction.

The manifest is not a summary of a separately authored `page.pptx`. It is the build contract for both page-level validation and final deck assembly. A page may not pass validation if the page PPTX can only be reproduced by custom page-local code while the manifest lacks object positions.

Must contain:

- `slide`
- `content_box`
- `source`
- `text_inventory`
- `visual_inventory`
- `background_strategy`
- `quality_checks`
- `text_boxes`
- `shapes`
- `images`
- `asset_provenance`
- page strategy

`slide`, `content_box`, and `source.width_px/source.height_px` must come from `page_request.json`. All `box_px`, `points_px`, and `polygon_px` values use `source.png` pixel coordinates; the runtime maps these coordinates into `content_box` instead of stretching them to the whole slide. Coordinate layouts:

- `box_px: [x, y, width, height]`
- `points_px: [x1, y1, x2, y2]`

Positioned build object requirements:

- Every `text_boxes[]` item must have `box_px`. Text in `text_inventory` does not create a positioned text box.
- Every `images[]` item must have `box_px`.
- Every non-line `shapes[]` item must have `box_px`.
- Every line shape must have `points_px`.

`text_inventory` and `visual_inventory` are only inventories; they do not substitute for positioned `text_boxes`, `images`, and `shapes`. The manifest must be sufficient to rebuild the page without reading any custom page script.

Missing coordinates are page-contract violations. The runtime must reject them during `editppt run record` and deck validation because otherwise missing values fall back to default positions such as the top-left corner.

Text-size fitting:

- `text_boxes[].font_size` is treated as the requested font size. The deterministic builder may clamp it downward during normalization when the requested size is too large for the resolved source-pixel box.
- Keep default fitting enabled for first drafts. Set `fit_text: false` only when the page author has manually calibrated the box and font size.
- `text_boxes[].box_px` should describe the source text bounds plus modest padding. Do not use an entire card, chart, table cell group, or unrelated container as the text box, because the fitter can only infer size from the box it receives.
- Optional tuning fields are `min_font_size`, `max_font_size`, `text_fit_safety`, and `line_height`.

`text_inventory` may be a list of strings or a list of structured objects. In structured objects, the fields used for exact text validation are `text`, `required_text`, `items`, or `texts`; fields such as `id`, `decision`, `description`, and `note` are only records and are not used for exact text matching. Example:

```json
[
  {"id": "title", "text": "Market Overview", "decision": "native-text"},
  {"id": "metrics", "required_text": ["Annual recurring revenue", "42.8M"]}
]
```

`quality_checks` must include at least:

```json
{
  "font_size_calibrated": true,
  "visual_inventory_matched": true,
  "background_strategy_checked": true,
  "shape_corner_geometry_checked": true
}
```

`background_strategy` must explain at least:

- `mode`: `native-or-script`, `source-preserving-local-cleanup`, `imagegen-full-clean-base`, or similar.
- `source_consistency_contract`: which composition, perspective, object positions, colors, lighting, and key details are preserved.
- `removed_foreground`: which foreground objects were removed from the background and rebuilt later.
- `comparison_note`: the background consistency conclusion after comparing the preview against the source.

`asset_provenance` requirements — every path referenced in `images[]` must have a matching entry:

- `path`: the image path as referenced in `images[]`.
- `source`: the file the asset was produced from (for separated assets and clean bases this is typically `source.png` or the recorded asset sheet; for formulas the `.tex` file). The referenced file must exist.
- `source_type`: exactly one of `asset-sheet-separated`, `imagegen`, `latex-rendered-formula`, `user-provided`, `user-approved-rasterization`. No other value passes validation.
- `provenance_note`: a non-empty explanation of how the asset was produced.

Validation keyword-scans the free text of `visual_inventory` and `asset_provenance` entries:

- An item whose description names a foreground object (icon, photo, logo, screenshot, badge, 图标, 照片, ...) must state its separation method in its text — include a term like "asset-sheet separated" / "image edit" / "分离" — unless the text marks it as background, formula, or native structure. Matching is substring-level, so words like "benchmark" or "trademark" also trigger the foreground check ("mark"); give native structural items an explicit "native structural" / "结构" marker in their description to exempt them.
- Terms naming forbidden fallbacks — "crop", "approximation", "fallback", "emoji", "裁剪", "近似", "降级", and similar — fail validation wherever they appear in these texts, even inside negations such as "no crop". Describe what was done ("asset-sheet separated from source"), not what was avoided.

`roundRect` shapes must record `source_corner_radius_px`; they may also record `corner_reason`. If the source is a straight-corner rectangle, use `rect`.

Recommended record:

```json
{
  "type": "roundRect",
  "box_px": [64, 169, 472, 187],
  "source_corner_radius_px": 12,
  "corner_category": "small-radius",
  "corner_reason": "source card corners are lightly rounded"
}
```

Allowed `corner_category` values: `straight`, `small-radius`, `large-radius`, `pill`. `straight` should not use `roundRect`.

`latex-rendered-formula` formula assets must record:

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "id": "formula_c2_1",
      "path": "assets/formula_c2_1.svg",
      "box_px": [105, 392, 390, 90],
      "alt": "LaTeX rendered formula formula_c2_1",
      "z_index": 220
    }
  ],
  "asset_provenance": [
    {
      "path": "assets/formula_c2_1.svg",
      "source": "assets/formula_c2_1.tex",
      "source_type": "latex-rendered-formula",
      "provenance_note": "Rendered from LaTeX by editppt formula render-latex; visual fidelity is prioritized over formula editability."
    }
  ],
  "formula_inventory": [
    {
      "id": "formula_c2_1",
      "decision": "latex-rendered-image",
      "editable": false,
      "image": "assets/formula_c2_1.svg",
      "tex_source": "assets/formula_c2_1.tex"
    }
  ]
}
```

Formula images must be generated by `editppt formula render-latex`. Do not use source-image formula snippets, and do not assemble complex formulas from hand-written native text boxes.

## `pages/page_NNN/imagegen-jobs.json`

Owner: created by `editppt prepare`, updated by `editppt image import` and `editppt image process-sheet` (`generate`/`edit`/`batch` do not write it — importing the selected output is what records the job).

Purpose: record the generation and processing process for clean bases, asset sheets, and selected bitmap assets.

State and provenance record rules are described in the State Principles section of `SKILL.md` and in the asset processing examples in `cli-helper.md`.

## `notes_manifest.json`

Owner: created by `editppt prepare`, read by `editppt run finalize`.

Purpose:

- Original PPT/PPTX speaker notes.
- Notes hashes.
- Page mapping.

Notes are not handed to page workers, translated, summarized, or rewritten.
